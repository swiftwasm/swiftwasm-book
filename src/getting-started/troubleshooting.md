# Troubleshooting

These are some common issues you may run into while using SwiftWasm.

If you are having trouble that is not listed here, try searching for it in the [SwiftWasm issue tracker](https://github.com/swiftwasm/swift/issues).

## `RuntimeError: memory access out of bounds`

If you encounter this error, there are 3 possible causes:

### 1. You are trying to access invalid memory in your code

In this case, you need to make sure which memory operations are invalid in your code by `UnsafePointer` or C code.

### 2. You missed program initialization defined in [WASI Application ABI](https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI/blob/bac366c8aeb69cacfea6c4c04a503191bf1cede1/legacy/application-abi.md).

If your application is used as a library, you need to follow [*WASI reactor ABI*](https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI/blob/bac366c8aeb69cacfea6c4c04a503191bf1cede1/legacy/application-abi.md).

Please make sure that you followed it by reviewing the [Exporting function guide](../examples/exporting-function.md)

### 3. Stack overflow is occurring.

If you are using `--stack-first` linker option (carton uses it by default), you can face `RuntimeError: memory access out of bounds` error due to stack overflow.

You have two options to solve this issue:
1. Avoid recursive calls if possible.
2. Extend the stack size by linker option `-z stack-size=<size>`. [The default stack size is 64KB](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/fabe915705472e2c06ed1aa9a90620462594e82f/llvm/include/llvm/BinaryFormat/Wasm.h#L32)
   ```
   swift build --triple wasm32-unknown-wasi -Xlinker -z -Xlinker stack-size=131072
   ```

2. Identify which function consumes a lof of stack space by some tools like [wasm-stack-consumer](https://github.com/kateinoigakukun/wasm-stack-consumer)
