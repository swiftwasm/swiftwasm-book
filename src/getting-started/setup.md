# Using Downloads

## macOS

An Xcode toolchain (`.xctoolchain`) includes a copy of the compiler, linker, and other related tools needed to provide a cohesive development experience for working in a specific version of Swift.


### Requirements

- macOS 10.15 or later


### Installation

1. Download the latest package release.
2. Run the package installer, which will install an Xcode toolchain into `/Library/Developer/Toolchains/`.
3. To use the Swift toolchain with command-line tools, use `xcrun --toolchain swiftwasm` or add the Swift toolchain to your path as follows:

```bash
export PATH=/Library/Developer/Toolchains/swift-latest.xctoolchain/usr/bin:"${PATH}"
```

4. Run `swift --version`. If you installed the toolchain successfully, you can get the following message.

```bash
$ swift --version
SwiftWasm Swift version 5.3 (swiftlang-5.3.0)
Target: x86_64-apple-darwin19.6.0
```

## Linux

Packages for Linux are tar archives including a copy of the Swift compiler, linker, and related tools. You can install them anywhere as long as the extracted tools are in your PATH.

### Requirements

- Ubuntu 18.04 or 20.04 (64-bit)

### Installation

1. Install required dependencies:


```bash
# Ubuntu 18.04
apt-get install \
          binutils \
          git \
          libc6-dev \
          libcurl4 \
          libedit2 \
          libgcc-5-dev \
          libpython2.7 \
          libsqlite3-0 \
          libstdc++-5-dev \
          libxml2 \
          pkg-config \
          tzdata \
          zlib1g-dev
# Ubuntu 20.04
apt-get install \
          binutils \
          git \
          gnupg2 \
          libc6-dev \
          libcurl4 \
          libedit2 \
          libgcc-9-dev \
          libpython2.7 \
          libsqlite3-0 \
          libstdc++-9-dev \
          libxml2 \
          libz3-dev \
          pkg-config \
          tzdata \
          zlib1g-dev
```

2. Download the latest binary release above.

The `swift-wasm-<VERSION>-<PLATFORM>.tar.gz` file is the toolchain itself.

3. Extract the archive with the following command:

```bash
tar xzf swift-wasm-<VERSION>-<PLATFORM>.tar.gz
```
This creates a usr/ directory in the location of the archive.


4. Add the Swift toolchain to your path as follows:

```
export PATH=$(pwd)/usr/bin:"${PATH}"
```

You can now execute the swiftc command to build Swift projects.
