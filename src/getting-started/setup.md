# Installation - Latest Release (Swift 6.0.3)

SwiftWasm provides [Swift SDK](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0387-cross-compilation-destinations.md)s for WebAssembly.

Before installing the Swift SDK, you need to ensure the following:

- You need to [install an Open Source toolchain from swift.org](https://www.swift.org/install/). (Not the Xcode toolchain)
- You cannot use toolchains bundled with Xcode to use the Swift SDK.
- If you are using macOS, please follow the [official guide](https://www.swift.org/install/macos/package_installer/) to install the toolchain.

Once you have installed the Open Source toolchain, you can install the Swift SDK for WebAssembly:

```bash
$ swift sdk install "https://github.com/swiftwasm/swift/releases/download/swift-wasm-6.0.3-RELEASE/swift-wasm-6.0.3-RELEASE-wasm32-unknown-wasi.artifactbundle.zip" --checksum "31d3585b06dd92de390bacc18527801480163188cd7473f492956b5e213a8618"
```

After installing the Swift SDK, you can see the installed SDKs:

```bash
$ swift sdk list
<SDK name>
...
```

You can also find other SDKs from [the GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/swiftwasm/swift/releases).

Use the following shell snippet to query compatible Swift SDK for your current toolchain version:

```console
(
  V="$(swiftc --version | head -n1)"; \
  TAG="$(curl -sL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swiftwasm/swift-sdk-index/refs/heads/main/v1/tag-by-version.json" | jq -r --arg v "$V" '.[$v] | .[-1]')"; \
  curl -sL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swiftwasm/swift-sdk-index/refs/heads/main/v1/builds/$TAG.json" | \
  jq -r '.["swift-sdks"]["wasm32-unknown-wasi"] | "swift sdk install \"\(.url)\" --checksum \"\(.checksum)\""'
)
```

## Hello, World

First, create a new directory for your project and navigate into it:

```bash
$ mkdir hello && cd hello
```

Create a new Swift package:

```bash
$ swift package init --type executable
```

You can use the installed SDKs to cross-compile Swift packages for WebAssembly:

```bash
$ swift build --swift-sdk wasm32-unknown-wasi
...
$ file .build/wasm32-unknown-wasi/debug/hello.wasm
.build/wasm32-unknown-wasi/debug/hello.wasm: WebAssembly (wasm) binary module version 0x1 (MVP)
```

You can run the built WebAssembly module using [`wasmtime`](https://wasmtime.dev/):

```bash
$ wasmtime .build/wasm32-unknown-wasi/debug/hello.wasm
Hello, world!
```

## FAQ

### How to check if I am using Open Source toolchain or Xcode toolchain?

```bash
$ swift --version | head -n1
```

| Toolchain | Output |
|-----------|--------|
| Xcode | `Apple Swift version 6.0.3 (swiftlang-6.0.3.1.10 clang-1600.0.30.1)` |
| Open Source (macOS) | `Apple Swift version 6.0.3 (swift-6.0.3-RELEASE)` |
| Open Source (Others) | `Swift version 6.0.3 (swift-6.0.3-RELEASE)` |

### What is the difference between the Swift Toolchain and the Swift SDK?

The Swift toolchain is a complete package that includes the Swift compiler, standard library, and other tools.

The Swift SDK includes a subset of the Swift toolchain that includes only the necessary components for cross-compilation and some supplementary resources.

### What is included in the Swift SDK for WebAssembly?

The Swift SDK for WebAssembly includes only the pre-built Swift standard libraries for WebAssembly. It does not include the Swift compiler or other tools that are part of the Swift toolchain.
