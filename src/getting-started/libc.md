# `WASILibc` module

When porting existing projects from other platforms to SwiftWasm you might stumble upon code that
relies on importing a platform-specific [C
library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_standard_library) module directly. It looks like `import
Glibc` on Linux, or `import Darwin` on Apple platforms. Fortunately, most of the standard C library
APIs are available when using SwiftWasm, you just need to use `import WASILibc` to get access to it.
Most probably you want to preserve compatibility with other platforms, thus your imports would look
like this:

```swift
#if canImport(Darwin)
import Darwin
#elseif canImport(Glibc)
import Glibc
#elseif canImport(WASILibc)
import WASILibc
#endif
```

## Limitations

WebAssembly and [WASI](https://wasi.dev/) provide a constrained environment, which currently does
not directly support multi-threading, or filesystem access in the browser. Thus, you should not
expect these APIs to work when importing `WASILibc`. Please be aware of these limitations when
porting your code, which also has an impact on what [can be supported in the Swift
Foundation](/getting-started/foundation.md) at the moment.
